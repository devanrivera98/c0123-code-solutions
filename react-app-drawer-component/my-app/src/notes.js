//  INSTRUCTIONS BELOW

// To make AppDrawer more reusable, it must accept the menu heading and items as props.

// Use JsDoc to document what the AppDrawer props should look like(including that items are in an array, and the shape of each item in the array).

// There may be any number of menu items.

// Menu items must be rendered in a separate component. (The component can be either in the same file as AppDrawer or a separate file.)

// The list of items should be defined in App.js at the top level.

//  INSTRUCTIONS ABOVE
