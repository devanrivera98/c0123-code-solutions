// INSTRUCTIONS BELOW

// The Accordion component should accept its topics as a prop(as an Array of Objects).

// Use JsDoc to document what the topics prop should look like(both that it is an array and the shape of the objects in the array).

// There may be any number of topics with accompanying details.

// Topics must be rendered in a separate component. (The component can be either in the same file as Accordion or a separate file.)

// The list of topics should be defined in App.js at the top level.
